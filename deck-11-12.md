# A Philosophy Of Software Design
John Ousterhout

---

## Chapter 11
Design It Twice

---

> Designing software is hard, so it's unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or system will produce the best design.

Always consider several possibilities!

---

* Pick radically different approaches
* Make a list of pros and cons of each

The best choice may be one of the alternatives, or you may discover that you can combine them into a new design!

---

Be careful with the _"really smart people"_ trap

---

Recap!

---

A module has two parts:

1. Interface
2. Implementation

---

Every interface has _formal_ and _informal_ aspects

---

An _abstraction_ is simplified view of an entity, which omits unimportant details

Every module provides an abstraction in form of its _interface_

---

## Chapter 12
Why Write Comments? The Four Excuses

---

Myth 1
## "Good code is self-documenting"

---

To be fair: there are multiple things we can do to reduce the need for comments _(for instance, good naming)_

But still a **significant** amount of the design information can't be represented in code! _(for instance, the informal interface)_

---

> If users must read the code of a method in order to use it, then there's no abstraction.

!!!

---

Myth 2
## "I don't have time to write comments"

---

Remember the _strategic approach_: if we believe something is important to the design, it's an integral part of our work, no matter the deadlines

---

Myth 3
## "Comments get out of date and become misleading"

---

* Process: many things can get out of date, like function names, and we have processes in place to make sure it doesn't happen
* Incremental approach: small changes in design lead to small changes in comment

---

Myth 4
## "All the comments I have seen are worthless"

---

Next chapters will have multiple techniques to write good ones! :)

---

> The overall idea behind comments is to capture information that was in the mind of the designer but couldn't be represented in the code.

Without documentation, future developers will have to rederive or guess at the developer's original knowledge
